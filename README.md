This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VBScript related to the IsEmpty function.  The IsEmpty function, while seemingly straightforward, can exhibit unexpected behavior when handling variant data types. This can be particularly problematic when dealing with empty strings ("") or uninitialized variables. The provided code demonstrates this behavior and offers a solution for more robust handling of potential empty or null values.
